# Restaurant-problem-decision_tree
Code Language - Python (version - 3)
Problem to wait for a table at a restaurant. A decision tree decides whether to wait or not in a given situation.
this is the basic implementation of it, dataset contains only 12 samples in total, as it is a very small dataset i have'nt splitted it and neither calculated the Entropy,
the code takes input from user, and based on that it predicts that one should wait or not.
